    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This borscht recipe comes from my friend's mother from Ukraine who taught me how to make this classic beet soup. 
        <br>It's as authentic as it gets, it can be served vegetarian-style by omitting the sausage.<br></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package pork sausage</li>
        <li>3 medium beets</li>
        <li>3 carrots</li>
        <li>3 medium baking potatoes</li>
        <li>½ medium head cabbage</li>
        <li>1 cup diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>8 ¾ cups water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Crumble sausage into a skillet set over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until no longer pink. 
            Remove from the heat and set aside. </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot halfway with water (about 8 cups) and bring to a boil. </li>
        <li>Add sausage to pot, cover pot, and return to a boil. Add beets and cook until they have lost their color. <br>Add carrots and potatoes and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes.<br> </li>
        <li>Add cabbage and diced tomatoes to pot</li>
        <li>Add onion and cook until tender</li>
        <li>Add garlic to the soup, cover, and turn off the heat</li>
        <li>Ladle into serving bowls</li>
    </ol>
