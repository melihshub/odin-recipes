    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken schnitzel recipe is a traditional German dish that is pounded thin with a meat tenderizer and is coated with breadcrumbs and then lightly fried. 
        <br>There isn't much better or easier than this when it comes to chicken.<br></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
              
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Pour 1 1/2 inches of oil into a large heavy pot or high-sided skillet. 
            <br>Clip on a deep-fry thermometer and heat the oil over medium-high heat to 360 degrees F.<br> </li>
            
        <li>Set up a dredging station: Place the flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs in each of 3 separate bowls. 
            <br>Season the breadcrumbs with the paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and a few turns of pepper.<br> </li>

        <li>Place a piece of chicken between 2 large pieces of plastic wrap and use a rolling pin or other blunt object to pound the chicken until it is as thin as you can make it without it tearing. 
            <br>Repeat with the remaining chicken. <br></li>
        <li>Coat the chicken first in the flour, then in the egg wash and finally in the breadcrumbs. 
            <br>Fry in batches, flipping once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes.<br> 
            Transfer to a wire rack set over a baking sheet to drain; season both sides with salt and pepper. 
            <br>Hold in a warm oven if not serving immediately. Serve with lemon wedges.<br> </li>
    </ol>
